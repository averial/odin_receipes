     <h1>Description</h1>
     <p>Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful South Asian rice dish, typically made with layers of aromatic basmati rice, marinated meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, or seafood), and a blend of spices. It's known for its complex flavor profile, often featuring ingredients like ginger, garlic, turmeric, chili, cumin, coriander, and caramelized onions. The dish is often cooked using the dum method, where it's sealed and slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together. </p>
